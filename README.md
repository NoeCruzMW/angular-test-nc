# Angular Test Noe Cruz 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

## Requirements
You need [node.js](http://nodejs.org) with [npm](http://npmjs.com) on your machine.
For some automatically npm builds you will even need a version of [python](http://www.python.org) installed, but this is not necessary to run the app itself.

## Installation
This app will install all required dependencies automatically. 
Just start the commands below in the root folder where you stored the package.
```SH
$ npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.



## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
